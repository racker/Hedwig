# hedwig-monitoring-library

This repo contains a library that can be used in accordance with [Rackspace Monitoring](https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/rackspace-monitoring/v1/api-reference/) for gathering and displaying metrics data.

## Getting started

Install its dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

`npm run build` builds the library to `dist`, generating three files:

* `dist/hedwig-main.cjs.js`
    A CommonJS bundle, suitable for use in Node.js, that `require`s the external dependency. This corresponds to the `"main"` field in package.json
* `dist/hedwig-main.esm.js`
* `dist/hedwig-main.umd.js`
    a UMD build, suitable for use in any environment (including the browser, as a `<script>` tag), that includes the external dependency. This corresponds to the `"browser"` field in package.json
    an ES module bundle, suitable for use in other people's libraries and applications, that `import`s the external dependency. This corresponds to the `"module"` field in package.json

## Documentation

The project uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) to generate a static site for documenting the library's intended usage and install instructions. In order to run this you must have both [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation) & [Ruby Gems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) installed on your system. To check you have both installed run commands:

```
ruby -v
gem -v
```

Once you have both installed you'll need to use the package manager gem to [install jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation). To launch locally navigate to the `docs` directory and from here run the Jekyll commands:

```bash
cd docs
jekyll build
jekyll serve
```
Now browse to http://localhost:4000


For installing hedwig library inside any other project, For e.g - Minerva, we need to run command `npm run release` inside Hedwig. This command creates `hedwig-monitoring-library.tgz` file. Now we need to attach this file to release section in Hedwig github repository to make a release which is already done by `script.js` file. Once it got published as a release, we then copy the URL link by right click on the `tgz` file and paste the same into package.json file of the project where it needs to be used, e.g: Minerva.

for e.g: if we want to use the same in Minerva project then the package file should look like : `"hedwig-monitoring-library": "https://github.com/racker/Hedwig/releases/download/v10.0.0/hedwig-monitoring-library.tgz"`


## Testing

Currently this project is handling visual regression testing with [BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) to create new reference files for the project run the command `npm run reference`.

This places images in the folder `test/backstop_data/bitmaps_reference`.

Once reference files are created, if none previously existed, you can now test graphs `npm run visual_test` builds the library, then tests it. If the page report html file doesn't open automatically you can view at `test/backstop_data/html_report/index.html`

## Notable Dependecies
* [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) - Javascript library for visualizing data, using SVG, Canvas & HTML elements.
* [babel](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-lib/tree/babel) - illustrates writing the source code in ES2015 and transpiling it for older environments with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
* [rollup-plugin-babel](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-plugin-babel) -
Seamless integration between Rollup and Babel.
* [jsdoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc) â€” JSDoc 3 is an API documentation generator for Javascript, we will use this to document our libary structure.
